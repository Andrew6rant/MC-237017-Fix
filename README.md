# MC-237017 FIX
Minecraft mod to fix [MC-237017](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237017) (All caves are filled with lava at and below Y value -54)

This mod is server-side only, and does not require anything on the client. Should work on all versions of Minecraft where this bug is present (1.18+, starting at snapshot 21w37a)
